## Deep Learning Homework

- Team name: DieWelle

### Project Specification

We chose our homework subject from the field of natural language processing. We would like to determinate the age and gender of bloggers based on their blog posts.
We have found a data set on kaggle, with more than 170,000 blog posts, each labeled with the authors age and gender.
