### Project Specification

We chose our homework subject from the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). We would like to determinate the age and gender of bloggers based on their blog posts.

### Data sets

We have found a data set on kaggle, with more than 170,000 blog posts, each labeled with the authors age and gender. We made the data processing on this set.

We have also found an other [data sets which contains twitter posts.](https://www.kaggle.com/s1m0n38/twitter-text-and-gender/version/1)

### Related work

We have found [this paper](https://cs224d.stanford.edu/reports/BartleAric.pdf) in the subject that gave us some ideas to try out later at the modelling fase, for example using a convolucional neural network.

### Plans

We would like to try different kinds of networks (fully connected, convolucional) and compare the results.
